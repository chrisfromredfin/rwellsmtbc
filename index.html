							<h2>So tell me... how exactly does this work?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The music therapist will evaluate a person's emotional well-being, physical health, physiological (bodily) responses, perceptual/motor skills, social functioning, communication abilities, and cognitive (mental and intellectual) skills through observation and discussion with the person and/or family members.</p>
						<p>The music therapist will identify and considers a personâ€™s musical background and musical preferences, then will collaborate and design goals and techniques that will be used within sessions to meet the person's needs. Some of these techniques include:</p>

						<ul class="override">
							<li>Music listening</li>
							<li>Lyric discussion & analysis</li>
							<li>Music-assisted relaxation</li>
							<li>Singing</li>
							<li>Instrument playing</li>
							<li>Improvisation</li>
							<li>Songwriting</li>
							<li>Musical entrainment (matching movement with the rhythm of the music).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The music therapist may also collaborate with other therapists, teachers, and doctors to ensure continuum of care.</p>

							<h2>5 Reasons to give Music Therapy a try!</h2>
						</header>
						<ol class="override">
							<li>Burned out on traditional therapies - Music therapy is a non-threatening, non-invasive therapy where individuals are provided an outlet to be creative, have opportunities for control over their environment, be social, and express their emotions</li>
							<li>Have a personal connection to music - who doesn't love music and you don't need any special musical ability to try!</li>
							<li>Wanting to treat multiple system goals without multiple types of therapy - one of the cool aspects is that a music therapist can work on varying types of needs, such as working on muscle movements while also working on speech development or work on pain management without the use of drugs while also working on sober living.</li>
							<li>No need to talk - music allows you to express your emotions, when words don't seem to do them justice.</li>
							<li>It is healthy! Believe it or not, when you listen to music, your body unconsciously responses. Music can influence heart rate and has even been shown to improve blood pressure levels. This makes sense, as music has the ability to lower feelings of stress and anxiety, which directly lowers blood pressure.</li>
