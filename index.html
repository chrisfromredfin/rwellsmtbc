							<h2>So tell me... how exactly does this work?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The music therapist will evaluate a person's emotional well-being, physical health, physiological (bodily) responses, perceptual/motor skills, social functioning, communication abilities, and cognitive (mental and intellectual) skills through observation and discussion with the person and/or family members.</p>
						<p>The music therapist will identify and consider a personâ€™s musical background and musical preferences, then will collaborate and design goals and techniques that will be used within sessions to meet the person's needs. Some of these techniques include:</p>

						<ul class="override">
							<li>Music listening</li>
							<li>Lyric discussion & analysis</li>
							<li>Music-assisted relaxation</li>
							<li>Singing</li>
							<li>Instrument playing</li>
							<li>Improvisation</li>
							<li>Songwriting</li>
							<li>Musical entrainment (matching movement with the rhythm of the music).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The music therapist may also collaborate with other therapists, teachers, and doctors to ensure continuum of care.</p>

								<h3>Music-Assisted Childbirth</h3>
								<div class="popup-info">
									Music Therapy Assisted Childbirth (MTACB) is designed for mothers and their partners who wish to utilize supportive music during labor. The therapist works with the family during the second and third trimesters to carefully construct personalized playlists that correspond with each stage of labor. Music tracks are mindfully selected to support the physiological processes of labor and delivery. Families can choose Birth Music Therapy where the music therapist attends the birth and implements the music program along with doula techniques, or Birth Music Consultation, in which a doula or birth partner are trained to implement the thoughtfully programmed playlists.

								<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
								<div class="popup-info">
									<h2>What is Music Therapy?</h2>
									<p>Music Therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.</p>
									<p>Music Therapy is an established health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. After assessing the strengths and needs of each client, the qualified music therapist provides the indicated treatment, including creating, singing, moving to, and/or listening to music. Through musical involvement in the therapeutic context, clients' abilities are strengthened and transferred to other areas of their lives. Music therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express themselves in words. Research in music therapy supports its effectiveness in many areas, such as overall physical rehabilitation and facilitating movement, increasing people's motivation to become engaged in their treatment, providing emotional support for clients and their families, and providing an outlet for expression of feelings.</p>

									<h2>What do music therapists do?</h2>
									<p>Music therapists assess emotional well-being, physical health, social functioning, communication abilities, and cognitive skills through musical responses; design music sessions for individuals and groups based on client needs using music improvisation, receptive music listening, song writing, lyric discussion, music and imagery, music performance, and learning through music; participate in interdisciplinary treatment planning, ongoing evaluation, and follow up.</p>

									<h2>What are some misconceptions about music therapy?</h2>
									<p>That the client or patient has to have some particular music ability to benefit from music therapy -- they do not. That there is one particular style of music that is more therapeutic than all the rest -- this is not the case. All styles of music can be useful in effecting change in a client or patient's life. The individual's preferences, circumstances and need for treatment, and the client or patient's goals help to determine the types of music a music therapist may use.</p>

									<h2>Is it covered by insurance?</h2>
									<p>Please note: We only accept out-of-pocket payments at this time, however if you would like to seek reimbursement, we will provide any documentation you may need.</p>

									<h3>Medicare</h3>
									<p>Music therapy can often be reimbursed by Medicare, under benefits for Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP). Music therapy must be prescribed by a physician, must be reasonable and necessary, based on a documented treatment plan, and the individual must be making documented progress.</p>

									<h3>Medicaid</h3>
									<p>Some states cover music therapy services under the Home and Community Based Waiver.</p>

									<h3>Private Insurance</h3>
									<p>Music therapy is covered by private insurance companies on a case by case basis. Services must be considered reasonable and necessary, and have a documented treatment plan.</p>

									<h3>Other</h3>
									<p>Once a music therapy assessment has been completed, if it has been determined that music therapy assists your child in meeting their IEP goals, music therapy can be added to your childâ€™s IEP. If this were the case, your childâ€™s school would possibly provide funding for services.</p>
									<p>There are other sources of funding out there, especially for families who qualify based on their income. Contact us for more information.</p>

							<h2>5 Reasons to give Music Therapy a try!</h2>
						</header>
						<ol class="override">
							<li>Burned out on traditional therapies - Music therapy is a non-threatening, non-invasive therapy where individuals are provided an outlet to be creative, have opportunities for control over their environment, be social, and express their emotions</li>
							<li>Have a personal connection to music - who doesn't love music and you don't need any special musical ability to try!</li>
							<li>Wanting to treat multiple system goals without multiple types of therapy - one of the cool aspects is that a music therapist can work on varying types of needs, such as working on muscle movements while also working on speech development or work on pain management without the use of drugs while also working on sober living.</li>
							<li>No need to talk - music allows you to express your emotions, when words don't seem to do them justice.</li>
							<li>It is healthy! Believe it or not, when you listen to music, your body unconsciously responses. Music can influence heart rate and has even been shown to improve blood pressure levels. This makes sense, as music has the ability to lower feelings of stress and anxiety, which directly lowers blood pressure.</li>
